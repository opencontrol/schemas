# Schemas

YAML schema, examples, and validators for OpenControl format. You can find the formal definitions and learn about how to do validation in the [`kwalify/`](kwalify/) folder. The examples from the Glorious (Fake) Nation of Freedonia are the complete standalone example targeted at OpenControl beginners, so we recommend looking at those first.

## Components

Components represent individual parts of an application or organizational policy that deal with specific security requirements. For example, in the [AWS compliance documentation](https://github.com/opencontrol/aws-compliance) the [EC2](https://github.com/opencontrol/aws-compliance/blob/master/IAM/component.yaml) component deals with access control and identity management security requirements. In the [Cloud Foundry compliance documentation](https://github.com/opencontrol/cf-compliance), the [UAA](https://github.com/opencontrol/cf-compliance/blob/master/UAA/component.yaml) the [Cloud Controller](https://github.com/opencontrol/cf-compliance/tree/master/CloudController) components deal with those requirements. In a straightforward Django-based application, for example, Django would be the component that deals with access control and identity management. As a developer building an SSP you most likely only deal with the component documentation.

### Examples

* [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://github.com/opencontrol/aws-compliance)
    * [The (simplified) Freedonia version](https://github.com/opencontrol/freedonia-aws-compliance)
* [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/opencontrol/cf-compliance)
* [Docker Datacenter](https://github.com/docker/ddc-opencontrol)

### Structure

```yaml
name: Name of the component
key: Key of the component (defaults to the filename if not present)
version: Version of the component
documentation_complete: Manual check if the documentation is complete (for gap analysis)
schema_version: 3.2.0
references:
  - name: Name of the reference ie. EC2 website
    path: Relative path of local file or URL ie. diagrams/diagram-1.png
    type: Type of reference ie. Image, URL
  - name: Name of the reference ie. EC2 website
    path: Relative path of local file or URL ie. diagrams/diagram-1.png
    type: Type of reference ie. Image, URL
verifications:
  - key: Key of verification
    name: Name of verification
    path: Relative path of local file or URL ie. diagrams/diagram-1.png
    type: Type of reference ie. Image, URL
  - key: Key of verification
    name: Name of verification
    path: Relative path of local file or URL ie. diagrams/diagram-1.png
    type: Type of reference ie. Image, URL
satisfies:
  - standard_key: Standard Key (NIST-800-53)
    control_key: Control Key (CM-2)
    narrative:
      - key: The optional key that represents a particular section of the control. If the key is not specified, assume the string in the following text represents the entire control
        text: The narrative text for the particular section / entire control if there is no key specified
    implementation_statuses:
      - Manual status of implementation (for gap analysis)
    control_origins:
      - The text representing the control origination.
    parameters:
     - key: "The key for a particular parameter of the specific control"
       text: "The parameter text for a particular parameter of a specific control"
    covered_by:
      - verification_key: The specific verification ID that the reference links, no component or system is needed for internal references
      - system_key: System name of the verification (can link to other systems / components)
        component_key: System name of the verification (can link to other systems / components)
        verification_key: The specific verification ID that the reference links to
```

### Validation

```bash
kwalify -f kwalify/component/v3.0.0.yaml examples/component_v3.0.0.yaml
# OR
pykwalify -s kwalify/component/v3.0.0.yaml -d examples/component_v3.0.0.yaml
```

## Standards

A standard is a list composed of individual security requirements called controls.

### Examples

```yaml
# nist-800-53.yaml
standards:
  C-2:
    name: User Access
    description: There is an affordance for managing access by...

# PCI.yaml
standards:
  Regulation-6:
    name: User Access PCI
    description: There is an affordance for managing access by...
```

## Certifications

Since standards can have thousands of security requirements (aka controls), agencies like the [GSA](http://www.gsa.gov/) or organizations such as [FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov) have curated a list of controls they require in order grant an IT system Authority to Operate (ATO). The GSA, for example, developed a certification called [the Lightweight ATO (LATO)](https://gsablogs.gsa.gov/innovation/2014/12/10/it-security-security-in-an-agile-development-cloud-world-by-kurt-garbars/), which uses only 24 controls.

### Example

```yaml
# Fisma.yaml
standards:
  NIST-800-53:
    C-2:
    C-3:
  PCI:
    6:
```
